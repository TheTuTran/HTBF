# HTBF

Repository of code used to create https://x.com/HTBFame

This is a simple app that I created to use Google Gemini AI's API. I created a simple prompt with instructions sent to the API. The response is a short blerp that I formatted into chunks that could be posted to twitter using tweepy. The code is ran every 24 hours on PythonAnywhere. Obviously, missing .env file, but it uses 4 APIs from twitter and an API from Google Gemini. I added links below to find the APIs if you want to do something similar like 'How millionaires became rich'.

Using PythonAnywhere, I created an automated task scheduler that runs these files every 24 hours.
